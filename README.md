# burgerLogger

The purpose of this website is create a Burger Logger, that tracks which burgers you wish to eat, which you have eaten and then add more burgers to your log to eat all using our own orm with MySQL. 


## Prerequisites

Visual Studio Code was used to build. NodeJS, express, MySQL and Handlebars were used.

## Process/What was Changed

This was built from the ground up and focused alot of folder creation and file organization as well as combine everything I learned from MySQL databases and express with NodeJS. Slowly starting with making the connection, inputing the data into the database, adding controllers and models. Then lastly, all the backend code with front end code to make a fully functioning web app.

## Review

I would be lying if I said this homework was easy. It seemed simple at first but there were alot of places where things went wrong for me. For some reason alot of my commits didn't go through and when I tried to go back and start over on something, I had to rebuild. Then, a few issues where based on missing characters that can be easily overlooked.
